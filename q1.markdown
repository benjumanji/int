```
SELECT count(*) as num_players, Rank

FROM Players

JOIN Levels ON (Players.Level_ID = Levels.Level_ID)

GROUP BY LevelName;
```

The problem here is that under aggregation all columns in the selection must either be the result of an aggregate functions, part of the grouping clause or a constant (or some combination). The solution is to add the `Rank` to the grouping clause. As aside, depending on the cardinality of the sets in question and how good the query planner is, it might be wise to aggregate on `Level_ID` and perform a join on the aggregated table.
